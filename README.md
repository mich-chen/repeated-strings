## Code Challenge: Repeated Strings
String `s`  of lowercase English letters that repeat infintitely. Given an integer `n` find and print the number of letter a's in the first `n` letters of the infinite string. For example, if the string `s = 'abcac'` and `n = 10`, the substring we consider is `abcacabcac`, the first `10` characters of the infinite string. There are `4` occurrences of `a` in the substring.

**Function Description:**
Complete the function, it should return an integer representing the number of occurrences of `a` in the prefix of length `n` in the infinitely repeating string.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: 'aba', 10
Output: 7
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: 'abca', 10
Output: 4
```
